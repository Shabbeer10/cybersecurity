Security Information and Event Management

Detection:
SIEM alerts are notifications generated by the SIEM system based on
predefined rules and correlation algorithms. These rules are typically customized
to meet an organisation's specific security requirements. When an event matches the 
defined criteria, the SIEM triggers an alert.

Main channel:
Severity - Indicates the level of severity (low, medium, high, critical)
Date - Displays the date of the incident.
Rule Name - identifies the specific rule triggered by the event.
EventID - Provides unique identifier for the event.
Type - specifies the type of event or alert triggered.
Action - Assign ownership of the alert to you for further investigation and analysis.
