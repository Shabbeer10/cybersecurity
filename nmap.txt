Step 1: Regular Port Scan (All Ports)
Check for open ports on a target to detect newly opened or unexpected ports.

nmap -p- 192.168.1.1

-p-: Scans all 65,535 TCP ports.
This will help detect any services running on non-standard ports.

Step 2: Service and Version Detection
Identify the services running on open ports and their versions to check for vulnerabilities.

nmap -sV 192.168.1.1

-sV: Performs version detection on services.
This gives you detailed information about whatâ€™s running on each open port (e.g., Apache 2.4.29).

Step 3: Vulnerability Scan
Use Nmap's vulnerability scripts to detect common vulnerabilities.

nmap --script vuln 192.168.1.1

--script vuln: Runs a collection of scripts to check for known vulnerabilities, such as misconfigurations, outdated software, and weak authentication mechanisms.

Step 4: Scan for Open UDP Ports
UDP services can often be overlooked but may pose a security risk.

nmap -sU 192.168.1.1

-sU: Scans UDP ports. Common services like DNS (53), SNMP (161), and NTP (123) use UDP.

Step 5: Check for Weak SSL/TLS Configurations
Identify weak ciphers, outdated protocols, or self-signed certificates.

nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 192.168.1.1

This checks for SSL/TLS vulnerabilities on services like HTTPS (443) and other encrypted connections.

Step 6: Detect Malware or Backdoor Ports
Malware or attackers might use non-standard ports or known backdoor services.

nmap -p 1024-65535 192.168.1.1

Scans all high ports (above 1024) to look for unusual services that could indicate compromise.
