CIA triad = 	Confidentiality(prevents unauthorized access to information, tools are 					encryption and access control, example is to encrypt emails so that 			only the intended recipient can read it),
		Integrity(ensure that information is unchanged unless authorized, tools used are checksum, digital signature, hashing),
		Availability().

confidentiality:
-authentication, who are you (access control)
-authorization, what are you allowed to do (encryption)

Integrity:
- make sure data is true to itself. (digital signature)

Availability:
-resources available only to authorized users 

threat types = malware, phishing, ransomware, insider threats, social engineering

key security controls:
-administrative: policies, employee training
-physical: locks, badges, surveillance
-technical: firewalls, encryption


TCP/IP: Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol
UDP: User Datagram Protocol

osi model has 7 layers
tcp/ip model has 4 layers

OSI model layers:
7. Application layer
6. Presentation layer
5. Session layer
4. Transport layer
3. Network layer
2. Data Link layer
1. Physical layer

TCP/IP model layers:
4. Application layer
3. Transport layer
2. Internet layer
1. Link layer/Network Access layer


#Explaining OSI layers:
1.physical layer;
- no address type
- devices: Cables, Network Cards, Hubs
- Data Type: Bits

2.data link layer;
-Address type: MAC Address
-Devices: Switches /Bridges
-Data type: Ethernet Frame (ethernet header, IP header, TCP header, data payload, ethernet trailer)

3.network layer;
-address type: IP Address
-Devices: Routers, Firewalls
-Data Type: Packet (IP header, TCP header, data payload)

4.transport layer;
-address type: Ports
-Devices: Routers,Firewalls
-data type: segments (TCP header, data payload)

5.session layer;
-managing sessions(session start and closed out, authentication and authorization)

6.presentation layer;
-Data translation, formatting, encryption, compression

7.application layer;
- has to do with how data shows up in UI that we interact with and how we input data

what is a port?
a port is an entry point -  like a doorway that can open and close

what is a protocol?
an established set of rules for network communications to work. each protocol has its own purpose.

some protocols---
IP(Internet Protocol)- about getting the address the data should go to.
TCP(Transmission Control Protocol)- enables application programs and computer devices to exchange messages.
UDP(User Datagram Protocol)- enables comms with low latency and loss tolerance. No acknowledgement needed. Used for treaming like netflix.





MSRA Microsoft Remote Assistance - get access to a remote user's desktop
no firewall or port forwarding required
user makes a request-sends an invit
techician connects-uses the password in the request
replaced by Quick Assist

find text in file?
linux command -grep- command to find text
windows command -wingrep
manual(view docs for command) eg. man grep
grep something(text in file) system.log(file name)

copy file?
cp(to copy file)
cp system.log(file to copy from) system.log.backup(file to paste to)
ls(list files specified) -la system.log


authenticate to wireless network using windows credentials?

cyber security is the protection of information in a system against malicious attacks
NIST national Institution of standards technology

no way to completely eradicate risk, only mitigate.

cyber security focus area: Network security

principles
defense in depth - not relying on 1 defense mechanism (avoid single point of failure)
least privilege - only certain authorizations
seperation of duties - no single point of control or
security by design - security should not be an afterthought. implement from design to completion
Keep It Simple Stupid - dont make it harder than necessary. secure but simple as possible.

Never do this!! **security by obscurity**

interview questions
What is on your home network?
-be technical.
Difference between threat, vulnerability, risk?
-vulnerability is a weakness in the system
-threat is a negative event
-risk is likelyhood of vulnerability being exploited by the threat
How would you go about securing a server? (open ended question, knowledge check)
-check CIS benchmarks for own personal server, guidlelines controls depending on what the server is used for.
Why is DNS monitoring important?
